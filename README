an old piece of messing, started out gluing Mina & async fastcgi code together with a view to making a really simple, lean J2EE-less app server to sit behind nginx. got as far as an application server with sessions serving basic requests and parsing post/get etc. started looking at putting sessions in memcached. got distracted and realised when i came back to it that there was too much other, better stuff out there to make this worth spending more time on. dumping here so as not to have to think about storing.
